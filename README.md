### About

movieAPI is an application I developed to improve my programming/developer skills. It uses two
different projects or applicantions, one (the backend) is a Ruby on Rails API app and the other
one (the frontend) is a React.js app which uses material-ui.

The backend app repository can be found [here](https://github.com/juannodeb/movieAPI).

The frontend app repository can be found [here](https://github.com/juannodeb/movie_client).

### How to use (if not using Heroku)

1. Open your terminal.

2. Check if you have ruby installed with `ruby -v`.

   If not installed use for example `rvm install 2.5.1` or google more ways to install it

3. Choose whether you want to clone or download the repository

   ***Download:***

   Click on the Clone or download button
   Click on Download ZIP
   Choose where to save the repository
   Extract the downloaded folder

   ***Clone:***

   Check if you have git installed with `git --version`
   If not installed use for example `sudo apt-get install git` or google more ways to install it
   Click on the Clone or download button
   Copy the link given
   Go to the terminal and cd into the folder you will clone the app
   Use `git clone git@github.com:juannodeb/movieAPI.git`

   ***Run the app:***

   cd into the project folder
   `bundle install`
   `rails s`
   The app would use the 3001 port to work with the client side app made with React.js
   Go to `localhost:3001` in your preferred browser

   To run all the tests you have to use `bundle exec rspec` or any variation of it in case you want to run any specific test.
